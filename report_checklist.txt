[ ]  It is clear how many networks you are going to analyse and their shape (monomodal, bipartite, etc.).

[ ]  For each network in the study, it is clear what are the nodes and what are the edges (when there exists an edge between nodes) and whether these are oriented or not.

[ ]  You apply a wide-enough range and number of measures to describe the phenomena you want to study (measures include centrality, groups, clustering, redundancy, equivalences, homophily, small-worldness, scale freedom, cohesion, connectedness, compactness, triad census, core-periphery, etc.).

[ ]  For each measure, you explain why you apply it (what phenomenon you investigate with it) and what semantics the measure has for your network (e.g., on a transport network, you apply betweenness centrality to find its most important junctions, since it measures the extent to which a node lies on paths between other nodes).

[ ]  The effort behind the study is appropriate for the number of students behind the project. Suggestion: projects can consider applying the same study design on different networks, to compare these (qualitatively and/or quantitatively) through the results of the same array of measures.
