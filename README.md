# Social Network Analysis of Twitter Bots

## Dataset
**TwiBot-22** (https://twibot22.github.io/) is a comprehensive graph-based Twitter bot detection benchmark designed to address limitations in existing datasets, such as limited scale, incomplete graph structures, and low annotation quality.

It is the largest dataset of its kind to date, offering diverse entities and relationships within the Twitter network.

The benchmark includes re-implementations of 35 representative Twitter bot detection models, evaluated across nine datasets, including TwiBot-22 itself, to promote fair comparisons and a holistic understanding of research progress.

Additionally, the TwiBot-22 evaluation framework consolidates all implemented codes and datasets, enabling researchers to consistently evaluate new models and datasets.
